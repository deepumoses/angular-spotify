# Angular-Spotify ðŸ‘¯ ðŸŽ¼ ðŸŽ¹ ðŸŽµ

This is `Angular-Spotify`, a Spotify redesigned PWA app that communicates with the Spotify Developer API.

See it in action [here](https://spotify-78866.web.app/).


If you wish to run the code locally run the following.

```
npm start
visit http://localhost:4200/
```

Please note that the Spotify API only provides 30 second audio snippets. It may be possible to get the full track by using the [Web Playback SDK](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/).
